### Portfolio 4: Customer Segmentation with K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering

- **Objective:** Apply unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment supermarket customers and generate data-driven insights that support personalised marketing strategies and business decision-making.
- **Process:**
   - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioural trends across 2,000 consumer records.
   - Conducted feature selection and data preprocessing, including standardisation and removal of non-informative attributes.
   - Built and evaluated scalable clustering pipelines using K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to identify distinct customer segments.
   - Compared clustering outputs, visualised results, and analysed cluster characteristics to ensure interpretability and business relevance.
   - Translating analytical findings into actionable business insights and targeted recommendations.
- **Outcome:** Defined four meaningful customer segments and provided strategy-driven marketing recommendations for each cluster. Demonstrated the ability to translate machine learning outputs into real-world business solutions, supporting data-informed decision-making and customer engagement improvements.
