### Portfolio 5: Airbnb Price Prediction

- **Objective:** Develop a predictive model to estimate Airbnb listing prices using structured property and host data in a group of 3.
- **Process:**
   - Conducted EDA to identify patterns in pricing, availability, reviews, and property characteristics.
   - Cleaned the data, addressed missing values, and removed redundant features to improve model reliability.
   - Engineered features such as normalised review rates and simplified availability indicators to enhance model interpretability.
   - Built supervised learning models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, and tuned hyperparameters for improved accuracy.
   - Evaluated performance using RMSE, MAE, and R²
- **Outcome:** The model achieved strong predictive accuracy and provided insights into factors influencing Airbnb prices, including location, room type, and availability patterns. Opportunities for improvement include implementing thorough preprocessing like systematic outlier handling, proper categorical encoding, and feature relevance analysis to fully captures the underlying patterns in the data.
